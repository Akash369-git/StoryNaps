            <h2>Life of Med School Through The Glasses</h2>
            <p>It is at 7:37 am on a rainy morning of second tuesday of September in 2018 that she thinks " did I make a
              mistake choosing medical field?." This is her first time thinking like this. ( Little does she know it is
              the first time for an upcoming zilionth times! ) </p>
            <p>For someone who is first one in her whole family tree to come in this field and whose only exposure to
              the life of a doctor is through some cheesy Indian daily soap, Dill Mill Gayye, reality is less pretty ,
              less pink and less presence of Dr. Armaan Malik. The last part is most depressing and she spends 3 days
              grieving about how cruel cable channels has lied to her. Don't take her wrong, she doesn't expect some la
              la land where patients are treated with pixie dust and doctors spend their time by singing around Disney
              musicals but excuse her a lil bit if the long gloomy corridors of hospital, cries of people from the
              postmortem house when they come to take the body and the mortuary just behind her hostel building do not
              seem very awe inspiring to her. Isn't it what she always dreams of?? Well let's have a glance at it.. </p>
            <div class="more-content">
              <p>The life in hostel is whole another story for her. She remembers watching and loving those high school
                chick flicks where the female lead goes through a full makeover and suddenly the nerdy braces wearing
                boring girl takes 180° turn and becomes someone straight out of Vogue cover. Well here she too gets her
                dream chance for makeover...But it's in reverse way. It involves less high fashion clothing and more
                salwar suits and an amount of hair oil which she's is sure will make her mom shed two tears of
                happiness.There are other rules also. Some she finds logical, some she finds funny and some she finds
                completely absurd. "I am supposed to remember all my Senior's name with their faces but I am not allowed
                to look at them.Also I would b honoured with the so called tag of the "Taazgi"(fresher) of the year if I
                could rattaficate all those couple's name just in the same way I used to pronounce the tables as a
                toddler
                in the kinder garden.. Does nobody think this is slightly absurd ?", she thinks frustratingly. She is
                told
                that all these rules are to strengthen the bond between juniors and seniors and only through utter
                determination, she barely avoids rolling her eyes. 1st year medicos are allowed to use hindi only but
                she
                ends up finding the whole thing quite informative and educational as she gets an opportunity to enrich
                her
                vocabulary with new words like "chur" ( crush/love) and kharab-pudina (badminton) and learn how to
                translate a full english rap song into hindi.Well there's a whole verse on that.. Just like the
                chronicles
                of Ramayana (the bal kand, aranya kand) there are many such kands... Will come to all these sooner or
                later ... </p>
              <p>Classes start and she finds that college life is pretty similar to school life, except the part where
                everything is 10 times more difficult and her comprehending skill getting inversely proportional.
                Everyday, from 9 a.m to 5 p.m, she spends her time struggling through the effort of not zoning out
                during
                lectures, gathering enough courage to "stab" her own finger with a needle for hematology practical
                (medicos take "gave my sweat and blood" too literally) and making mnemonics for the mnemonics of the
                mnemonics for the actual answer. Surely she is learning but still there's sense of being lost. Learning
                so
                much of vocabulary she sometimes wonder " one day it will be so extensive that my cervical vertebrae
                ,nucleus pulposes and annulus fibroses would no longer be strong enough to lift this huge burden".. </p>

              <p>She is in her first histology practical class and after squinting her eyes through the microscope for
                nearly 15 minutes , when she can't make a single sense out of it except that it is pink, she turns to
                her classmate and asks "which part of slide should I actually look at?". " Uhmm... maybe the pink part.
                " The answer of course does not help her with histology but she smiles realizing that everyone is
                equally lost as her. Talk about small mercies! </p>
              <p>Now the infamous dissection class turns out to be everything and more. It's gross, it's terrifying but
                oddly fascinating. She feels that she is justified in her obvious hesitation in peeling down the skin
                from cadaver when she hasn't even cut a chicken in her life. Ah!! that night is more horrifying to her
                than a nightmare could ever be ..That old man lying in some sort of uneasy posture soaked in the
                formalin does not get out of her head.A point also transpires when her hands start shaking even with the
                thought of scalpel and the forceps .It is then when her ethics and morals came to her aid ."Our
                perception towards the things has the power to change anything" as mentioned by her mother .. Aah!!
                Their values and etiquettes always come by our side in the worst of our times.. And of course she is
                doing this in the greater welfare of the mankind.. Doesn't she?? After 2 weeks when she finds her hands
                and even face deep into the cavity of thorax of a cadaver, trying to find a nerve, it hits her that
                actually everything is not that bad. Barring the smell of formalin . It remains bad. </p>
              <p>As time passes, things do not become easier but it becomes easier to handle things. Friends help too.
                Friends help a lot. From blowing up test tubes in biochemistry lab to saving "safest" seats in
                physiology tutorial classes where u could find a good network access to lending a shoulder to cry when
                homesickness becomes too much to handle. Friends always help.</p>

              <p> She learns that medicos live in two extreme phase. Either they are busy making heart eyes at the pages
                of Grey's Anatomy with kind of passion which can give Peter Kavinsky a run for his money or partying
                like there's no tomorrow. There's no middle ground. They treat agreement for a mass bunk like a blood
                pact and couples are made with the clear intention of getting married and nothing less. She is 90% sure
                that the couple sitting in bench next to her has already decided on which coaching center they'll send
                their future doctor kids to. In conclusion medicos are a bunch of strange weirdos with a very concerning
                obsession with attendance and stethoscope so much that they could even perform their "varmala" with the
                stethoscope.. </p>

              <p>The leaves on the trees in front of her dorm window are back in the same color as in the start of
                session and with that it brings the first professional exams. She goes through her written exams in an
                okay-ish way. She is mostly relieved that her 2 a.m library trips with her friends bitching about
                "Preeti sikka" for her dormancy do not turn out to be for nothing.
                Viva and practical exam though is everything a medico's nightmare is made of. After her first viva she
                is convinced that the external professor used to probably give Raghu and Rajiv free tutions for Roadies
                audition. But guess the grilling is justified considering the stakes.</p>


              <p>Finally it all ends.. Don't take it too serious as the other chronicles r yet to be explored and now as
                she waits for her result in her room in her home , she looks back to everything. One full year and now
                she fully understands it's not a walk on cake. But for all the issues, complains and whining, she can't
                think of a version of herself where she gives up on it..Inspite of all these still like a trainee hero
                she is destined to save lives and you know that's make her absolutely awesome..</p>
